So `commit` stores away all this history, what can we do with it?

## git log

Check how far we have come! 
Take a look at your repository's history of commits:

```
git log

git log --oneline
```

> When a long text display fills the terminal window, navigate up and down using the arrow keys or Page Down key. 
> To exit the display, type `q`.

## git diff

We can compare files with the history.
Modify one of the file in your repository using a text editor or the command line.

```
echo "more important notes!" >> notes.txt

git status

git diff

git diff notes.txt

git add notes.txt

git diff

git commit -m "testing diff"

git diff
```

`diff` allows us to see what changes were made to the currently unstaged files. 
It's best to check this before you commit to ensure you know what you are changing.
Many text editors have a diff visualization built in, which is very handy!

## git checkout

Wait that last commit was no good! How can we undo?

Let's get the earlier version back with `checkout`.
You can track individual commits using their id given by `git log`. 
Or we can refer to them sequentially. 
The most recent commit is called `HEAD`. 
One back is called `HEAD~1` ("head minus one"), and so on. 
If you `git checkout` a specific file, it will reset it to the specified commit in your working directory.

```
git checkout HEAD~1 notes.txt

git status

git diff HEAD notes.txt

git checkout HEAD notes.txt

git status
```

Those two checkouts undid each other!
If you want to save the undo, remember to `add` and `commit`.
Using this method ensures that we have a record of what was undone, just in case you want to undo your undo.

```
git checkout HEAD~1 notes.txt

git status

git add notes.txt

git commit -m "undo notes changes"
```

> if you get 'detached HEAD' warning, type `git checkout master`


## .gitignore

Sometimes there are files that you do not want version controlled or sent to your remote repository.
Create a `.gitignore` file in the repo to tell Git to ignore things.
Global ignores are generally added by the Git installer, and local ones are often automatically generated by project templates or your IDE.
